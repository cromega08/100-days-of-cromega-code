# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 0 - Cromega

The diary part of my "100DaysOfCode" challenge. Started on 25-04-2022.

## Log

The current file its gonna be use it as a diary juornal trough my first 100 Days of Code Challenge, after my first year of programming.

I've decided to follow this challenge to learn web design, that's my goal.

If you want the log (resumed version) read: https://github.com/cromega08/100-days-of-cromega-code/log.md

My CodePen profile, where i upload all the designs i made: https://codepen.io/cromega08

My Hashnode blog for the challenge: https://100daysofcromegacode.hashnode.dev/

### R0D0
 
A great Start, updating my journal the next day. Actually, i think i'm gonna do it this way, to start the day with an organized diary. 
 
However, the first day i've started by organizing my personal readme in my profile and cloning this repo to do the challenge, after that started thinking about what to do and getting a litted frustrated, so stoped and just enter internet to be one with what could come. After that the improvement come.
 
In code things, i've practice in codewars.com some katas, 3 katas of 5kyu. After that, find a video of a cool css effect and want to try it, so i've followed the tutorial and recreated, with my great style.

The effect it's made with a text covered by a element and an animation to move that element, revealing in steps the text hidden; in addition, added an apparition effect with my logo and slogan.

### R0D1

Second Update of my journal, and following the system of next day.

I started by organizing all the records for this challenge, updating a blog on Hashnode i made for the challenge and my CodePen profile to show my work.

After that, decided to continue creating another effect, this time a Glitch effect. Ive made it with some "span text" and shadows, all animated to change the position of each shadow and accomplish the break effect with the glitch.

### R0D2

Third update, but late cause the time to write was consumed by code.

Decided to start another challenge and made it with this, the "100 Days of Daily UI". I know that challenge isn't for programming, actually, but its the motivation i need to finally learn Frontend, since ive never do it before.

I coded a Sign Up Page with html/css only, its the model without any backend.

Repo: https://github.com/cromega08/sign_up_page

Pen: https://codepen.io/cromega08/pen/zYROZqJ

### R0D3

Four day, and find the first obstacule that dont let me upload complete code on that day.

I continue with the challenge of 100 Days of Code/DailyUI, but today challenge was a credit card checkout. And you say: "What is so bad? It so easy" and it is, but i wanna challenge and try to do a dropdown menu. And you ask, again: "Why is so bad? That its easy, too", and it is, but i decided to do it with images.

It seems that html/css have problem with images align on menus, so that was my problem. Try with buttons, nav elements, input images, anchor and images, and all of them doesnt response for my design, i need to learn further more of frontend design to know how to do it.

So, today there's no repository or pen, just the record for my first problem in the challenge.

### No-Challenge-Day: Problems of the Day

At first, this would be the 5 day of the challenge, but not.

Have some problems with my computer and os, so was imposible to make something personal actually.

The most i do in code was practice JavaScript in the night, as the last thing of the day. 

I hate it. I don't know what people love about it, i just hate the language. The syntax and the problems for nothing, i just hate it. Don't know if it's 'cause i've practice with a game called "JavaScript Robot", not directly with personal code, but have stupid problems as fails in coditionals for not enter new lines (literally fixed when enter new lines).

So, today doesn't count for external problems.

### R0D4

Today was a productive day, it was absolutly worth it.

Different to yesteray, today wasnt any problem and can code in peace. In the opposite record of yesterday, today started learning JS in a way i like it.
Haow they called: "The modern JS tutorial". And yes, the lesson are completly ease to understand and explain the language with the most recents updates.

After that, ended the credit card checkout, i leave you the link below. Resolved the problem with "position: relative" and a mix between "display: (inline-block/flex)", but at end only need flex.

### R0D5

Another productive day, and not only in frontend development.

The day started with a practice of Python. Have a few days without building python code, and today did it again. Resolve some kata in codewars and all my morning was in that.

In the afternoon continue with the lessons of JS, and after i get completly satisfied for the day (in the morning i studied moreless) decided to make a challenge of DailyUI.

Today, design a UI for a simple Calculator app, but with my style. Doesn't have any backend at the moment, but i'm gonna update that project later, when i learn enough of JS.

P.D: Decided to keep this records at date 'cause... yes, so, 2 updates the same day, but for differents dates.

### R0D6

A productive day, in a very special way.

The first thing of the day was fix my last web designs, 'cause clearly wasn't finished. Didn't have responsive implementations or the eleents wasn't installed. So, i refined that's designs and ended very proud of the result.

After that come the special thing: Resolve my first kata in JS (YEEESSS!!!). Officially know the syntaxis of JS, and not only that, learn to make some "one line code" in a efficient way and resolved a kata with the same level of my training with Python. The epifany of the words: "You could switch between the language if you know the syntax and have a good logic" come to my mind, was an amazing realization, improve my confidence more than alredy it's (I'm the best).

So, i don't do any new thing, but improve my the knowledge alredy have, which it's super important.

"Don't fear the man with a thousand techniques, fear the man who masters one to perfection."

### R0D7

More than a week in the challenge, today it's a special day because i'm only code the hour required for the challenge.

I was outside all day and watch "Dr. Strange in Multiverse of Madness" at the end, so was a relaxing day most of all. Resting it's important.

The code for both challenges was to design a brand logo. I recreate with code the instagram logo in 2 versions and make an animation to switch among both.

### R0D8

Today was a weird day. Awake and lift up with a big energy, refined the Instagram Logo, added responsive animations to switch among to designs and pulish other details.

After that, only practice some coding in JS, learn about "Functions Expressed" and accomplish some katas in codewars.

Want and need to make some new projects, planning to expend weekend on a big project.

### R0D9

Was a very productive day.

Coded a "404 - Page not Found" template for the challenges and was pretty instructive in display css options.

The problem it's my energy, started to feel burnedout for all the things i'm coding daily non-stop. But not gonna give up, this challenge until date be the most productive thing that improvement my programming skills and don't wanna give up at all.

10 Days accomplished and continous.

P.D: Fucking Github doesn't count my last update and lost my streak at almost a week of commiting every day ;-;

### R0D10

Wasn't a productive day.

My brain was drained today, feel pretty tired actually when refer to coding. I planned to do some challenge i'v been defering from "100 Days of Daily UI" 'cause are very difficult for my level. Are design a "Landing Page" for a website design a "Settings menu" and design a "Profile Menu".

And you say: "Why it's difficult? it's pretty basic for any web developer know that" and yes, i agree. But i started learning web design almost at the same time started thi challenge, it's mean at least 2 weeks ago. So decided to take all the weekend to code this 3 pages and make a simulated website that run in a local repositorie (non a real website, only design), but feel drained and ended practicing katas and resolving some things in my personal life.

### Resting Day

Today i felt tired and decided to rest.

Resting days are important, right? So, today was that day. Decided to take apart for one day all the projects and just make side things i wanted to try.

Decided to try some flutter/dart code, study some syntax 'cause i wanna learn it some point and feel it very similar to JS, set up android studio for it and that was my day. Just making vaious thing without code anything.

### R0D11

Today was a great and very productive day.

Return with a great energy and coded a Music Player UI, only the interface when you're listening a song.

Planned to add a interface with a carrusel of the page to select songs, both in the same html to uploaded to codepen.

Feel very energic and comforted with the coding, a great motivation in my soul.

### R0D12

Was a very happy day, productive and interesting in interesting discoveries.

Today refined the music_player_ui, in the DailyUI challenge was challenged to design a sharing menu and take the opportunitie to add it to the project, and in the inspiration wave, add the options menu that i was reserving to a landing page, but the opportunitie come and take it.

And, to complete the design, add other buttons to end the design: a back button, add_to_playlist, change the colors in animations... at the end, just ended with something great that makes me happy and improve my confidence with html and css, feel the difference with the star of the line.

After that, com the second good part. Discovered a programming language multi-propose with a very useful properties and beautiful sintax, with inheterided qualities from other great languages: Crystal. Read about it and it's seem beautiful and very useful for my objectives, and seem some project with blockchain write on it that just rise the hype.

So, i installed the compiler and tools to learn it in the  part of this challenge.

I decided to split htis challenge in 3 parts: 33 Days of Frontend, 33 Days of Backend and 33 Days of Blockchain/Web3.

### R0D13

 A worth it day, started a little problematic but fixed.
 
 Started coding after breakfast, challenge today was design "Flash Messages", one positive and one negative, so i designed both using anchor elements, but had a problem while creating because edited one element and checked changes in other... happens to the best of all.
 
 But, notice my mistake and designed in a organized way and all ended on road, i'm not satisfied with the result but the challenge doesn't allow more, this is'nt something super difficult.
 
 On other hand, discover a very interesting website to learn blockchain and gonna explore it to know what is, but until the moment it's just a curiosity.

### R0D14

Today was a productive and epiphanic day.

Started the day with the current challenge, which its a Landing Page, so started coding it. There's where the epiphany come, i didn't started learning responsive design yet, 'cause i have a wrong concept about what it was.

I think until yesterday that responsive mean "not static": animations, personalization, style... Things like that, but no, it wasn't.

So, made some math and started a daily course of one of my favorite youtuber to frontend design, called "Kevin Powell". Didn't like the methodology of "One content per day", cause it's automated and it's borign, doesn't let me flow, but it is what it is.

It's a free course of 27 days, so gonna ended at the same time the first part of this challenge, but i think it's worth it. Gonna use it as a complement and learn other side topics in the same line by my own.

### R0D15

I forgot that i'm more than 2 wekks in the challenge, interesting.

Wake up with the motivation to code, but found a challenge so rough: design a message app.

So, decided to try other page with challenges and found a challenge of coding a card, so try it. Fail with responsive design.

But, the design was awesome, so it was worth it.

Later, practice python after some time.

### R0D16

Todya wasn't a very productive day.

Started by changing the units in the "NFT Preview Card", published, changed the buttons in the "Landing Page" and added a link to the original page. That's all.

On side, practice some flex in css, learn some properties i dont know even exist, and not much more.

Repo: https://github.com/cromega08/nft_preview_card

### R0D17

Gonna be honest, this record isn't made on the date would be, it's made 2 days later.

On the 17 day don't happen anything, actually, was my typing and erasing anything i do and make side searching of other things, my mind didn't sit and code that day. The useful thing i made was track a specified road for the frameworks and technologies i'm gonna learn, thats all.

###Problems-Day

Because personal problems, this day i don't code, only put aside the computer, didn't was a rest day, i didn't want even to rest, it's because certain health problems, so nothing.

### R0D18

We back with all the energy.

After the needed rest day, today was a very productive day. Ended the responsive design for both of my last projects and published the pen of both. Learn the basic of the "Markdown" language and overwrite my first big README.md for the NFT Card. Publish both project on a Github Page for the first time and was very interesting, but with the automatics tools that github include, i didn't configure anything yet, but planning to learning on side and publish other projects with it.

### R0D19

Started to design a pop-up/overlay design from the "100 Days of DailyUI" Challenge and learn more about the modals. Started to organize other personal things and ended with the design published. Learn about how the "svg" works and their attributes.

###R0D20

Started to design a Chat App Illustration, from a Frontend Mentor Challenge, but only code in the morning 'cause do other things in the day, so just was that.

### R0D21

Ended the design that started yesterday, wasn't complicated and feel pretty easy to ser elements. The difficult part was to set the @media-queries to make it responsive, was a hell 'cause need to work for many screen sizes and, as an illustration, broke pretty easy in differenc screens, wasn't an app itself so the sizes need to adapt and... was complicated.

On the other hand, feel very stressed about the time to accomplush my goals in this challenge, doesn't learn JS for Frontend and rest 10 days for the limit i put to myself, so feel complicated to accomplish, my mind feel tired.

* Chat_App_Illustration: [Repo](https://github.com/cromega08/chat_app_illustration) - [Pen](https://codepen.io/cromega08/details/gOvxWOJ)

### R0D22

Feel tired, absolutly tired, my mind doesn't focus today, just jump among things i want to do and was a total caos.

Doesn't code anything, at the end was a theory day. Learn about how the internet works, http protocol and the OSI model. Learn about how to debbug JS on browser (the theory, doesn't debbug anything yet) and other concepts to set the mentality of a web developer an the tools used for it. Learn the base of DOM and it's manipulation, too, but feel pretty hard and gonna be a problem to learn, but gonna put all my effort into it, as always.

### R0D23

Today was a commiting day.

The last 4 records before this was maded today because i didn't have the energy and the space in my brain to do it, so just was postponed in favor of my mental health and my improve in the objective of this challenge, which it's to learn web3.

And, things apart, today need to rest because tomorrow start a programming course.

 **I win a scholarship!**

I win it weeks before, but this isn't a personal diary, so until this moment doesn't was a problem for the challenge, but starting tomorrow need to divide my time between that course and my own challenge. So, gonna keep some updates about it to.

### Challenge in hiatus | Stopped

Well, almost a week from last update. This gonna be short, the scholarship isn't what i expected and i'm gonna have to teach myself and the time consumed by this it's more than expected, plus that i'm not gonna do the hazing and nonsense of learning more than 1 topic at time, that just gonna burn my brain.

So, for external causes, this gonna stand here for the moment and not gonna update or anything. I'm continue learning by myself, I haven't give up on the goal for which I started this challenge, i'm gonna be a blockchain developer at the end of the third trimester of this year, but gonna do it at my time and mixed with the new things in my life.
