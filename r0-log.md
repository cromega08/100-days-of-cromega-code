The current file its gonna be use it as a diary juornal trough my first 100 Days of Code Challenge, after my first year of programming.

I've decided to follow this challenge to learn web design, that's my goal.

### R0D0
 
A great Start, updating my journal the next day. Actually, i think i'm gonna do it this way, to start the day with an organized diary. 
 
However, the first day i've started by organizing my personal readme in my profile and cloning this repo to do the challenge, after that started thinking about what to do and getting a litted frustrated, so stoped and just enter internet to be one with what could come. After that the improvement come.
 
In code things, i've practice in codewars.com some katas, 3 katas of 5kyu. After that, find a video of a cool css effect and want to try it, so i've followed the tutorial and recreated, with my great style.

The effect it's made with a text covered by a element and an animation to move that element, revealing in steps the text hidden; in addition, added an apparition effect with my logo and slogan.

### R0D1

Second Update of my journal, and following the system of next day.

I started by organizing all the records for this challenge, updating a blog on Hashnode i made for the challenge and my CodePen profile to show my work.

After that, decided to continue creating another effect, this time a Glitch effect. Ive made it with some "span text" and shadows, all animated to change the position of each shadow and accomplish the break effect with the glitch.

### R0D2

Third update, but late cause the time to write was consumed by code.

Decided to start another challenge and made it with this, the "100 Days of Daily UI". I know that challenge isn't for programming, actually, but its the motivation i need to finally learn Frontend, since ive never do it before.

I coded a Sign Up Page with html/css only, its the model without any backend.

### R0D3

Four day, and find the first obstacule that dont let me upload complete code on that day.

I continue with the challenge of 100 Days of Code/DailyUI, but today challenge was a credit card checkout. And you say: "What is so bad? It so easy" and it is, but i wanna challenge and try to do a dropdown menu. And you ask, again: "Why is so bad? That its easy, too", and it is, but i decided to do it with images.

It seems that html/css have problem with images align on menus, so that was my problem. Try with buttons, nav elements, input images, anchor and images, and all of them doesnt response for my design, i need to learn further more of frontend design to know how to do it.

So, today there's no repository or pen, just the record for my first problem in the challenge.

### No-Challenge-Day: Problems of the Day

At first, this would be the 5 day of the challenge, but not.

Have some problems with my computer and os, so was imposible to make something personal actually.

The most i do in code was practice JavaScript in the night, as the last thing of the day. 

I hate it. I don't know what people love about it, i just hate the language. The syntax and the problems for nothing, i just hate it. Don't know if it's 'cause i've practice with a game called "JavaScript Robot", not directly with personal code, but have stupid problems as fails in coditionals for not enter new lines (literally fixed when enter new lines).

So, today doesn't count for external problems.

### R0D4

Today was a productive day, it was absolutly worth it.

Different to yesteray, today wasnt any problem and can code in peace. In the opposite record of yesterday, today started learning JS in a way i like it.
Haow they called: "The modern JS tutorial". And yes, the lesson are completly ease to understand and explain the language with the most recents updates.

After that, ended the credit card checkout, i leave you the link below. Resolved the problem with "position: relative" and a mix between "display: (inline-block/flex)", but at end only need flex.
