# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Current Round: 0

### Day 0: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Train in codewars.com and recreate a typewritter effect with html/css.

**Thoughts:** I'm new with front development, need to practice that. Need to put more effort on the curse for Web Development in freecodecamp.org.

### Day 1: April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Organized my records for the journal and design a Glitch effect with html/css.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting more confident with animations and learning a lot of pseudo-classes and new tags.
